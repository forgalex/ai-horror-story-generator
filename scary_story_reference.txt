Okay, so this happened to me a few months back... and honestly, I still get a weird feeling... when I think about it.

It was late... maybe around 1 AM... and I was driving back home. It's kind of a rural area where I live... lots of trees... not a lot of lights on the roads. Just me... and the headlights cutting through the dark. I had the radio on low... just to have some noise.

As I was driving... I passed this old church. It's set back a bit from the road... and even during the day... it looks kind of abandoned... and creepy. But at night? With the shadows... and everything? It was seriously unsettling.

And then... as I was passing it... my headlights caught something in the churchyard. There was this figure... standing by one of the gravestones. My first thought was maybe it was someone visiting a grave late at night... which is already a little strange... right?

But then I got a better look. This person was tall... really tall and skinny... almost unnaturally so. And they were just completely still. Facing the gravestone... but their head was tilted at this really weird angle... like it was broken... or something.

I just got this instant feeling that something was wrong... like deep down wrong. My foot just slammed on the gas... I just wanted to get away from that place.

As I sped up... I glanced back in my rearview mirror. The figure was still there... still not moving... head still tilted. But now... now it looked like it was facing my car.

I didn't dare look back again. I just kept driving... trying to shake the image out of my head. That tall... still figure... in the dark.

The really messed up part? A few days later... I was talking to someone at work who lives around there... and the old church came up somehow. They said there were always rumors about it being haunted... that people had seen things there at night.

And then they mentioned this story. Years ago... apparently... there was a man found dead in the churchyard. And his neck... it had been twisted.

I haven't driven that way at night since. And honestly... every time I think about it... I can still see that figure in my rearview mirror. Just standing there... head tilted... watching me drive away. It still creeps me out.
