In the desolate expanse of a barren countryside, where civilization seemed to have retreated, there stood an imposing edifice, the once grand Hotel Mariana. Its once resplendent facade now crumbled and decayed, a testament to the relentless passage of time. The hotel, abandoned for decades, was shrouded in an eerie silence, broken only by the creaks and groans that echoed through its hollow corridors.

It was a moonless night, and the wind whistled mournfully as it swept across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decay. In the distance, the silhouette of the hotel loomed ominously against the darkness, beckoning to those who dared to tread upon its forsaken grounds.
