Well, this happened during one camping trip with some friends about five years ago...

It was an ordinary weekend — we’d all agreed to meet up at our favorite campsite in the mountains. The weather had been perfect; clear skies and a crisp cool night that promised fun nights around bonfires.

We set off early on Friday afternoon as planned, packed everything from marshmallows for roasting over campfires...to essentials like food supplies (because you always bring more than necessary), tents...

Our first stop was to check-in at the campsite. Everything looked fine — just what you'd expect: clean and well-kept facilities.

We pitched our tent right next to a big, open field with an eerie vibe about it; shadows cast long across rocks by moonlight... A strange feeling washed over me as we spread out sleeping bags inside...

That first night was great though. We told stories — some of ours were spooky tales too… like how I once saw someone lurking around my car when no one else could see them.

But come morning, a sudden chill hung in the air; it wasn't just cold outside anymore... something felt wrong ...

It started with whispers that you couldn't quite place ... footsteps behind us we weren’t seeing. The rustling of leaves sounded different — too eerily quiet and purposeful...

We all tried to convince ourselves there was nothing unusual happening… But I couldn’t shake off this feeling; like someone—or some spirit—was watching over our heads, lurking in the shadows.

Later that day... We decided it would be good for us if we split up briefly. Each group went on a small hike — an hour away from base camp…

I found myself alone and wandering deeper than I’d ever gone before… When suddenly there was this dark shape out of nowhere; turning towards me like my own shadow turned its head... except, it wasn't just that.

My hands shook as he reached for mine. My pulse raced through the bone — what if someone had been waiting to scare us into doing something? Someone who could take advantage?

I broke free and sprinted back ... faster than I’d ever run before… like there were chains pulling me... dragging, slowing my pace down.

Breathing heavily as sweat poured off of me when finally reaching our campsite safely — but a chill still lingered; what had just happened...

That night we gathered in groups again around the bonfire. We shared stories that weren't so happy now ... tales about encounters with spirits or mysterious figures lurking nearby ...

A few hours later… another strange thing started happening... Someone was walking through my tent, leaving behind footprints on snow.

The next morning when I checked inside it felt like someone had been there … except — no footsteps were left; not even a trace. 

I couldn’t shake off the feeling that we weren't alone up here ... That whatever happened during those hours of wandering ...

... some spirit was out for more than just harmless scare stories and would-do-or-die adventures.

And I know this might sound silly, but … now whenever it’s quiet in these mountains at night… there's always a whispering wind carrying faint voices calling my name. No matter how many times I've told myself it's only an illusion — something from our own minds ...

But what if there are whispers because someone was listening too? Someone who’d been waiting for us ... to start this terrifying adventure again.
